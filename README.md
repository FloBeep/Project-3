**Project Goals**

Data Cleaning: Handle missing or inconsistent data, format data types, and prepare the dataset for analysis.<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform initial exploration of the dataset, including basic statistics and distribution analysis.<br>
Industry Analysis: Analyze the representation of different industries in the billionaire list.<br>
Country Analysis: Explore how billionaires are distributed across different countries and regions.<br>
Gender and Age Analysis: Investigate the age distribution, gender balance, and how these factors relate to net worth.<br>
Net Worth Distribution: Study the distribution of net worth across all billionaires and identify any wealth concentration trends.<br>
Visualizations: Create visual representations of key insights, including:<br>
Bar chart and histograms (e.g., country-wise billionaire count, industry representation).<br>
Box plots (e.g., distribution of net worth by industry).<br>
Word cloud (e.g., Source of wealth).<br>
Heatmaps (e.g., country-wise billionaire density).<br>


**Key Insights (Preliminary Results)**

Wealth Distribution: The wealthiest individuals are concentrated in a few industries, with technology and finance leading the pack.<br>
Country Representation: The United States, China, and India host the highest number of billionaires, while emerging economies show rapid growth.<br>
