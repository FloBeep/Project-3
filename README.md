**Project Goals**

Data Cleaning: Handle missing or inconsistent data, format data types, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform initial exploration of the dataset, including basic statistics and distribution analysis.
Industry Analysis: Analyze the representation of different industries in the billionaire list.
Country Analysis: Explore how billionaires are distributed across different countries and regions.
Gender and Age Analysis: Investigate the age distribution, gender balance, and how these factors relate to net worth.
Net Worth Distribution: Study the distribution of net worth across all billionaires and identify any wealth concentration trends.
Visualizations: Create visual representations of key insights, including:
Bar chart and histograms (e.g., country-wise billionaire count, industry representation).
Box plots (e.g., distribution of net worth by industry).
Word cloud (e.g., Source of wealth).
Heatmaps (e.g., country-wise billionaire density).


**Key Insights (Preliminary Results)**
Wealth Distribution: The wealthiest individuals are concentrated in a few industries, with technology and finance leading the pack.
Country Representation: The United States, China, and India host the highest number of billionaires, while emerging economies show rapid growth.
Age and Gender: Billionaires are predominantly male, with no number of female billionaires, and most of them are aged between 50 and 70.
Self-Made vs. Inherited: A significant percentage of billionaires on the list have self-made fortunes, particularly in tech and retail industries.
